# Rock, Paper, Scissors
Console-based version of the classic game powered by JavaScript.

## Summary
Rock, Paper, Scissors! game app. For now, the main focus is code logic. CSS styles and 
a Graphical User Interface will be implemented at a future point. The goal for now is to get 
the game itself to function correctly.

I should note that I'm no stranger to JavaScript or programming logic in general, but if I'm 
being quite honest, JavaScript never was my "strongest" ability and it's been years since I've 
done anything productive with it. This project exists for the discipline and practice.
